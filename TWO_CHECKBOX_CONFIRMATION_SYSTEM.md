→ Buyer clicks "Confirm Order"
→ Modal opens with two checkboxes
```

### **Step 2: Two Critical Checkboxes**

**Checkbox 1 (CRITICAL):**
```
✓ I have received the product(s)

Required: YES - Must confirm physical receipt
Purpose: Verify delivery completed
```

**Checkbox 2:**
```
✓ I am satisfied with the product(s)

Required: No, but recommended
Purpose: Verify product quality/expectations met
```

### **Step 3: Decision Flow**

**Scenario A: Both Checked ✅✅**
```
Received: ✓ YES
Satisfied: ✓ YES
    ↓
Optional ratings (1-5 stars)
    ↓
Click "Confirm & Release Payment"
    ↓
✅ Order marked "completed"
✅ Escrow released to vendor
✅ Vendor gets paid
✅ Transaction recorded
```

**Scenario B: Received but Not Satisfied ✅❌**
```
Received: ✓ YES
Satisfied: ✗ NO
    ↓
Click "Report Issue"
    ↓
⚠️ Dispute form appears
⚠️ Buyer describes issue
⚠️ Submit dispute
    ↓
❌ Escrow HELD
❌ Admin notified
❌ Vendor notified
⏸️ Awaits admin resolution
```

**Scenario C: Not Received ❌**
```
Received: ✗ NO
Satisfied: ✗ NO (doesn't matter)
    ↓
Click "Report Issue"
    ↓
⚠️ Dispute form appears

```

## 🛡️ Buyer Protection

### **What Buyers Can Do:**

**1. Confirm Satisfaction:**
- Both boxes checked
- Payment released to vendor
- Order completed

**2. Report Non-Delivery:**
- "Received" unchecked
- Creates dispute
- Escrow held
- Admin investigates

**3. Report Quality Issues:**
- "Received" checked
- "Satisfied" unchecked
- Creates dispute
- Escrow held
- Admin reviews

### **Escrow Protection:**
```
Buyer dissatisfied → Dispute created → Escrow FROZEN ❄️

Admin reviews case:
- Contacts buyer
- Contacts vendor
- Reviews evidence
- Makes decision:
  → Refund to buyer, OR
  → Release to vendor
```

---

## 📝 Dispute Resolution Process

### **When Dispute is Created:**

**1. Escrow Status:**
```
Order status: "disputed"
Escrow status: "held_for_dispute"
Amount: ₦10,000 (FROZEN)
```

**2. Notifications Sent:**
```
✉️ To Admin:
"New Dispute Requires Review
Order #12345678 has been disputed by the buyer.
Escrow funds are on hold."

✉️ To Vendor:
"Order Disputed
Order #12345678 has been disputed by the buyer.
Admin will review."
```

**3. Admin Dashboard:**
```
New dispute appears in Admin panel
Shows:
- Order details
- Buyer complaint
- Escrow amount
- Contact info for both parties

Actions:
- Contact buyer
- Contact vendor
- Review evidence
- Make decision
```

**4. Admin Resolution:**
```
Option A: Release to Vendor
→ Vendor was correct
→ Buyer complaint invalid
→ Release escrow to vendor
→ Order marked "completed"
→ Notify both parties

Option B: Refund to Buyer
→ Buyer was correct
→ Product issue/non-delivery
→ Refund escrow to buyer
→ Order marked "refunded"
→ Notify both parties
```
