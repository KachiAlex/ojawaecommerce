# Shipment Tracking Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Carrier Field Not Pre-Populated** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: The "Mark as Shipped" modal showed an empty carrier field, requiring vendors to manually type the logistics partner name.

**Root Cause**: The carrier field wasn't using the logistics partner that the buyer selected during checkout.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Pre-populate carrier field with buyer-selected logistics partner
- ✅ Make field read-only to prevent vendor from changing buyer's choice
- ✅ Add helpful information explaining this was selected by the buyer

### 2. **Tracking Number Visibility** ❓ → ✅
**Question**: Where does the buyer see the tracking number that the vendor enters?

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Tracking number is stored in the order document when vendor confirms shipment
- ✅ Buyer can see it in the "Track Delivery" modal
- ✅ Shows both internal tracking ID and carrier tracking number
- ✅ Includes instructions on how to use the carrier tracking number

  order?.logisticsCompany || 
  order?.logisticsPartnerName || 
  ''
);
```

    <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-1">
      📦 Use this number to track on {order.shippingCarrier || 'carrier'} website
    </p>
