## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Pricing Strategies

### Strategy 1: **Hybrid Flat + Per-Km Pricing** (RECOMMENDED)
âœ… **Best for:** Most logistics partners

**How it works:**
- Flat rates for short distances (intracity)
- Per-km pricing for longer distances
- Clear, predictable pricing

**Example:**
```
Intracity:
- 0-5 km: â‚¦500
- 5-15 km: â‚¦1,000
- 15+ km: â‚¦80/km

Intercity:
- All distances: â‚¦50/km (tiered)
```

**Pros:**
- Customer-friendly for short trips
- Profitable for long distances
- Easy to understand

---

### Strategy 2: **Pure Per-Km Pricing**
âœ… **Best for:** Specialized/long-distance operators

**How it works:**
- Single per-km rate for each category
- Add weight and speed multipliers
- Minimum charge enforced

**Example:**
```
Intracity: â‚¦80/km (min â‚¦500)
Intercity: â‚¦50/km (min â‚¦2,000)
International: â‚¦200/km (min â‚¦100,000)
```

**Pros:**
- Simple calculation
- Transparent pricing
- Easy to compare

**Cons:**
- May be expensive for short trips

---

### Strategy 3: **Zone-Based Pricing**
âœ… **Best for:** Urban intracity operators

**How it works:**
- Divide city into zones
- Flat rate between zones
- No per-km calculation needed

**Example:**
```
Same zone: â‚¦500
Adjacent zones: â‚¦800
2 zones apart: â‚¦1,200
3+ zones apart: â‚¦1,500
```

**Pros:**
- Very simple for customers
- Predictable revenue
- No distance disputes

**Cons:**
- Requires zone mapping
- Less flexible

---

### Strategy 4: **Package Size Pricing**
âœ… **Best for:** E-commerce focused

**How it works:**
- Price by package dimensions + weight
- Volumetric weight calculation
- Standardized package sizes

**Example:**
```
Small (shoebox): â‚¦500
Medium (briefcase): â‚¦1,000
Large (suitcase): â‚¦2,000
Extra Large: â‚¦3,500
```

**Formula:**
```
Volumetric Weight = (Length Ã— Width Ã— Height) / 5000
Chargeable Weight = Max(Actual Weight, Volumetric Weight)
```

**Factors:**

```

Reward frequent shippers:

| Monthly Volume | Discount |

| 1-10 deliveries | 0% |
| 11-50 deliveries | 5% |
