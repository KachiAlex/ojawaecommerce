## 📚 Documentation Created

1. **`ADDRESS_AUTOCOMPLETE_GUIDE.md`** - Complete user and developer guide
2. **`GOOGLE_MAPS_AUTOCOMPLETE_SUMMARY.md`** - This file (quick overview)

## 🎓 How to Maintain

### If Autocomplete Stops Working

1. **Check API Key**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console
   - Verify API key is valid
   - Check HTTP referrers include your domain

2. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for errors like "REQUEST_DENIED"
   - Follow error message instructions

3. **Check API Quotas**
   - Go to Google Cloud Console → APIs → Quotas
   - Ensure you haven't exceeded limits

### If You Need to Customize

1. **Change Country Restriction**
   - Edit `componentRestrictions: { country: 'ng' }` in `AddressInput.jsx`
   - Change `'ng'` to your country code

2. **Change Autocomplete Types**
   - Edit `types: ['address']` for street addresses
   - Edit `types: ['(cities)']` for cities only

3. **Customize UI**
   - Edit Tailwind classes in `AddressInput.jsx`
   - Change icons (📍, 🏙️, ✅)
   - Adjust colors and spacing

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Requires Internet**: Autocomplete needs online connection
2. **Nigeria Only**: Currently restricted to Nigerian addresses (can be changed)
3. **Manual Fallback**: Users can still type manually if autocomplete unavailable
4. **API Costs**: May incur costs if usage exceeds free tier

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Potential Future Improvements
1. **Address Validation** - Verify address exists before submission
2. **Geolocation** - Auto-detect user's current location
3. **Address History** - Remember frequently used addresses
4. **Map View** - Show address on interactive map
5. **Multiple Countries** - Support international addresses
6. **Caching** - Cache frequent addresses to reduce API costs
