# 🛒 Cart to Checkout Flow - FIXED!

## 🐛 The Problem

The checkout page wasn't receiving delivery fee data from the cart because:

1. **Wrong React Router syntax** - Cart was using React Router v5 syntax:
   ```javascript
   // Old (v5) - DOESN'T WORK in v6 ❌
   to={{ pathname: "/checkout", state: { data } }}
   ```

2. **Checkout not using hook** - Checkout was expecting `location` as a prop instead of using `useLocation()` hook

## ✅ The Fix

### File 1: `apps/buyer/src/pages/Cart.jsx`

**Changed:** Link component to use React Router v6 syntax

```javascript
// NEW (v6) - WORKS ✅
<Link
  to="/checkout"
  state={{
    deliveryOption,
    selectedLogistics: selectedLogistics || routeInfo?.selectedPartner,
    routeInfo,
    buyerAddress,
    vendorAddress: vendorInfo?.address,
    calculatedDeliveryFee: routeInfo?.price || 0
  }}
  onClick={() => {
    console.log('🛒 Cart - Passing to Checkout:', {
      deliveryOption,
      calculatedDeliveryFee: routeInfo?.price || 0,
      routeInfo,
      buyerAddress
    });
  }}
>
  Proceed to Checkout
</Link>
```

### File 2: `apps/buyer/src/pages/Checkout.jsx`

**Changed:** Import and use `useLocation()` hook

```javascript
// Added import
import { useNavigate, useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

// Changed component
const Checkout = () => {  // Removed { location } prop
  const location = useLocation();  // Added hook
  const cartData = location?.state || {};
  // ... rest of code
}
```

## 🧪 How to Test (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Go to Cart
```
http://localhost:5173/cart
```

### Step 2: Add Items to Cart
- Add at least one product to your cart
- You should see the cart items displayed

### Step 3: Select Delivery Option
- Select **"Delivery"** (not "Pickup")
- You should see the delivery address fields appear

### Step 4: Enter Delivery Address
Use the **Google Maps autocomplete**:
1. Click on "Street Address" field
2. Type: `"Lagos"` or `"Victoria Island"` or any address
3. Click on a suggestion from the dropdown
4. The address fields should auto-fill

### Step 5: Wait for Delivery Pricing
After entering the address, you should see:
- A loading indicator
- Then delivery pricing appears
- "Delivery Summary" box showing:
  - Route (e.g., "Lagos → Lagos Island")
  - Distance (e.g., "15km")
  - Delivery Fee (e.g., "₦1,500")

### Step 6: Check Cart Total
In the cart summary box (right side), verify:
```
Subtotal: ₦10,000
Delivery Fee: ₦1,500  ← Should show!
Service Fee (5%): ₦500
VAT (7.5%): ₦863
Total: ₦12,863  ← Should include delivery!
```

### Step 7: Open Browser Console
Press **F12** and look at the Console tab. You should be ready to see logs.

### Step 8: Click "Proceed to Checkout"
Watch the console for this log:
```
🛒 Cart - Passing to Checkout: {
  deliveryOption: "delivery",
  calculatedDeliveryFee: 1500,
  routeInfo: { ... },
  buyerAddress: { ... }
}
```

### Step 9: Check Checkout Page
On the checkout page, you should see:

**In Console:**
```
🛒 Checkout - Cart data received: { ... }
💰 Checkout - Calculated delivery fee: 1500
🚚 Checkout - Route info: { ... }
💰 Checkout - Pricing breakdown calculated: { ... }
```

**On Page:**
```
Order Summary:
├─ Subtotal: ₦10,000
├─ Delivery Fee: ₦1,500  ← MUST SHOW! ✅
├─ Service Fee (5%): ₦500
├─ VAT (7.5%): ₦863
└─ Total: ₦12,863  ← MUST INCLUDE DELIVERY! ✅
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### If Delivery Fee Still Doesn't Show:

#### 1. Check Console Logs

**In Cart (before clicking checkout):**
```
Look for:
✅ Route calculation logs
✅ Delivery pricing logs
✅ "🛒 Cart - Passing to Checkout" log
```

**In Checkout (after clicking):**
```
Look for:
✅ "🛒 Checkout - Cart data received"
✅ "💰 Checkout - Calculated delivery fee"
✅ Should NOT be 0 or undefined
```

#### 2. Check Cart State

Make sure in the Cart page:
- `deliveryOption === 'delivery'` (not 'pickup')
- `routeInfo` is not null
- `routeInfo.price` has a value (not 0 or undefined)
- Address is fully filled (street, city, state)

#### 3. Check Navigation

In the console, when you click "Proceed to Checkout", you should see:
```javascript
{
  deliveryOption: "delivery",  // Not "pickup"
  calculatedDeliveryFee: 1500,  // Not 0 or undefined
  routeInfo: { price: 1500, ... },  // Not null
  buyerAddress: { street: "...", city: "...", ... }  // Not empty
}
```

#### 4. Verify React Router Version

Check `apps/buyer/package.json`:
```json
"react-router-dom": "^6.x.x"  // Should be version 6
```

If it's version 5, the fix won't work. Upgrade to v6.
