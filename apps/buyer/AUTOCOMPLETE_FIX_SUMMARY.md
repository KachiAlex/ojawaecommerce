## 🚀 How to Test RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Make Sure Dev Server is Running

```bash
cd apps/buyer
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Open Test Page

Go to: **http://localhost:5173/test-autocomplete**

### Step 3: Check Diagnostics

At the top of the page, you'll see 4 diagnostic boxes:

```
✅ Google Maps Loaded
✅ Places API Available
✅ API Key Configured
✅ Service Initialized
```

**All should be ✅ green!**

If any show ❌ red, scroll down to the troubleshooting section on the page.

### Step 4: Test the Autocomplete

1. Click on the "Street Address" field
2. Type: **"15 Marina"** or **"Victoria Island"** or **"Lagos"**
3. Wait ~0.5 seconds
4. **You SHOULD see a dropdown with Google Maps suggestions!**
5. Click any suggestion
6. All fields should auto-fill

### Step 5: Check Console Logs

1. Open browser console (press `F12`)
2. You should see detailed logs like:

```
🚀 Starting Google Maps initialization...
📡 Google Maps initialized: true
🎯 Creating AutocompleteService...
✅ Google Places Autocomplete fully initialized!
🔍 Fetching predictions for "15 Mar" (type: street)
📍 Autocomplete status: OK
📍 Predictions received: 5
✅ Setting autocomplete results: 5
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: No Dropdown When Typing

**What to check:**
1. Open browser console (F12) and look for errors
2. Make sure you typed at least 2 characters
3. Wait 0.5 seconds after typing
4. Check if internet is working

**Console shows "Autocomplete service not available":**
- The Google Maps script might not have loaded
- Reload the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
- Check API key configuration

**Console shows "REQUEST_DENIED":**
- Your domain needs to be whitelisted
- See Issue 2 below

### Issue 2: "REQUEST_DENIED" Error

**This means:** Your API key is configured but domain restrictions are blocking it.

**Fix:**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click on your API key: `AIzaSyCw_5hgEojEOW1hAIewyb4TkyHTN2od-Yk`
3. Under "Application restrictions" → "HTTP referrers", add:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/*
   http://localhost:*
   http://127.0.0.1:*
   https://ojawa-ecommerce.web.app/*
   https://ojawa-ecommerce.firebaseapp.com/*
   ```
4. Under "API restrictions", ensure these are enabled:
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
   - Directions API
5. Click "Save"
6. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to propagate
7. Reload the page

### Issue 3: Google Maps Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Diagnostics show ❌ for "Google Maps Loaded"
- Console shows script loading errors

**Fix:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify API key in `apps/buyer/vite.config.js`:
   ```javascript
   'import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY': JSON.stringify('AIzaSyCw_5hgEojEOW1hAIewyb4TkyHTN2od-Yk')
   ```
3. Make sure Places API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue 4: "ZERO_RESULTS"

**Symptoms:**
- Dropdown doesn't appear
- Console shows "ZERO_RESULTS"

**This is normal!** It just means Google couldn't find matches for what you typed.

**Solutions:**
- Try a more common address (e.g., "Lagos", "Victoria Island")
- Type more characters (at least 3)
- Check you're searching in the right country (currently Nigeria)

## 📊 Test on Real Pages

Once the test page works, try it on actual pages:

### Cart Page

```
http://localhost:5173/cart
```

1. Add something to cart
2. Go to cart page
3. Select "Delivery" option
4. Find the address input
5. Start typing
6. Should see autocomplete!

### Vendor Registration

```
http://localhost:5173/become-vendor
```

1. Fill in vendor registration form
2. Find "Business Address" section
3. Start typing in address field
4. Should see autocomplete!
