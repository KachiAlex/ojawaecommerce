## 💡 Why This Happened

### **During Development:**
- Products were created with test data
- Some used `sample-vendor-id` placeholder
- Some had no vendor ID at all
- Some were assigned to wrong vendors
- No validation to ensure correct vendor ID

### **Prevention:**
When creating products in the future, always ensure:
```javascript
{
  name: 'Product Name',
  price: 9999,
  vendorId: '4aqQlfFlNWXRBgGugyPVtV4YEn53', // ✅ Required!
  // ... other fields
}
```
