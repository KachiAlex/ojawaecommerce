## 🏗️ Data Structure

### **Product Schema Addition:**
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  processingTimeDays: 2, // Number of days (default: 2)
  // ... other fields
}
```

### **Order Schema Addition:**
```javascript
{
  // ... existing fields
  vendorProcessingDays: 2,
  logisticsShippingDays: 3,
  totalDeliveryDays: 5,
  estimatedDeliveryDate: Date, // Order date + totalDeliveryDays
  deliveryDeadline: Date, // estimatedDeliveryDate + 2 days buffer
  estimatedDelivery: 5, // Backward compatibility
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 📊 How It Works

### **For Vendors:**
1. Edit or create product
2. Select processing time from dropdown (default: 1-2 Business Days)
3. Save product
4. Processing time is now set for that product

### **For Buyers:**
1. View product → See "Vendor Processing: X Business Days"
2. Add to cart → Processing time is remembered
3. Select logistics → See total delivery breakdown:
   - Vendor processing: 2 days
   - Shipping: 3 days
   - **Total: 5 days**
4. Place order → Order stores all delivery time data

## 🔒 Escrow Integration

### **Delivery Deadlines:**
- `estimatedDeliveryDate`: When delivery is expected (order date + total days)
- `deliveryDeadline`: Deadline with buffer (estimatedDeliveryDate + 2 days)

### **Future Uses:**
- Track late deliveries automatically
- Trigger disputes if delivery is late
- Auto-release escrow after confirmed delivery + buffer
- Vendor performance metrics (on-time delivery rate)
