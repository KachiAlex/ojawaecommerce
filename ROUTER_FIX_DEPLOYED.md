# ✅ React Router Fix - useLocation Error FIXED

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Error:** `useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component`

**Root Cause:** The `useLocation()` hook was being called in `OnboardingWrapper` component **before** it was wrapped inside the `<Router>` component.

**Status:** ✅ FIXED & DEPLOYED

---

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

### **The Error:**
```
Error: useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
    at gt (vendor-react-CN8Ca2Wt.js:50:330)
    at wl (vendor-react-CN8Ca2Wt.js:50:9328)
```

### **The Bad Code:**
```javascript
const OnboardingWrapper = () => {
  const location = useLocation(); // ❌ Called OUTSIDE Router!
  
  return (
    <Router>
      {/* ... */}
      <Routes key={location?.pathname}> {/* ❌ location is undefined */}
        {/* routes */}
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

**Problem:** `useLocation()` requires the component to be a **child** of `<Router>`, but we were calling it in the **parent** component that wraps the Router.

---

## ✅ The Fix

### **Created Separate Component Inside Router:**

```javascript
// Component that wraps Routes with location-based key (must be inside Router)
const RoutesWithLocationKey = () => {
  const location = useLocation(); // ✅ Now called INSIDE Router!
  
  return (
    <Routes key={location.pathname}> {/* ✅ location is now available */}
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/products" element={<Products />} />
      <Route path="/cart" element={<Cart />} />
      {/* ... all other routes */}
    </Routes>
  );
};

// Main wrapper component
const OnboardingWrapper = () => {
  // ✅ No useLocation() here anymore!
  
  return (
    <Router>
      <ScrollToTop /> {/* This uses useLocation - but it's INSIDE Router */}
      <main>
        <RoutesWithLocationKey /> {/* ✅ Component that uses useLocation INSIDE Router */}
      </main>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

### **What Changed:**

1. ✅ **Removed** `const location = useLocation()` from `OnboardingWrapper`
2. ✅ **Created** new component `RoutesWithLocationKey` that:
   - Is rendered **inside** the `<Router>`
   - Calls `useLocation()` safely
   - Wraps `<Routes>` with location-based key
3. ✅ **Replaced** all duplicate route definitions with single component call

## 🎉 Results

### **Error Fixed:**
- ❌ Before: `useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component`
- ✅ After: No errors, app loads correctly

### **Navigation Still Works:**
- ✅ Route changes detected: `🔄 Route changed to: /cart`
- ✅ Components re-render on navigation
- ✅ No refresh needed

### **Vendor Address Still Correct:**
- ✅ Shows: "30 Adebanjo Street, Lagos, Lagos, Nigeria"
- ✅ Fetched from server
- ✅ No mock address

## 🧪 Test Now

### **Clear Cache First:**
```
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached files
OR
Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
```

### **Test the App:**
```
1. Go to: https://ojawa-ecommerce.web.app
2. ✅ App should load without errors
3. ✅ Console should be clean (no useLocation errors)
4. Click "Cart" → ✅ Should load immediately
5. Click "Products" → ✅ Should load immediately
6. Check cart vendor address → ✅ Should show "30 Adebanjo Street"
```

### **Check Console:**
```
✅ Should see: "🔄 Route changed to: /cart"
✅ Should see: "✅ Vendor data fetched: Ojawa Mock Vendor 30 Adebanjo Street..."
❌ Should NOT see: "useLocation() may be used only in the context of a <Router>"
```

## 📚 React Router Hook Rules

### **Important Rule:**
**Router hooks (useLocation, useNavigate, useParams, etc.) can ONLY be used inside components that are children of `<Router>`**

### **Correct Usage:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <MyComponent /> {/* Can use useLocation */}
    </Router>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  const location = useLocation(); // ✅ Works!
  return <div>{location.pathname}</div>;
}
```

### **Incorrect Usage:**
```javascript
// ❌ INCORRECT
function App() {
  const location = useLocation(); // ❌ Error! No Router yet!
  
  return (
    <Router>
      <div>{location.pathname}</div>
    </Router>
  );
}
```
